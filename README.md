# FCalcACC

This is an application made in Visual Studio 2022 using C# Windows Form for calculating fuel and pit strategy for Assetto Corsa Competizione. 

Originally project was created in python using tkinter GUI. Old script can be found in 'FCalcACC\python_old_script'.

Release version requieres .NET 8.0 Framework to work (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0). Larger size exe release that is independent from .NET version can be found in 'FCalcACC/self_contained'.

Application is creating a 'FCalcACC_data.json' at first start up. This file stores user data.

Future plan is to add telemetry integration with ACC.
