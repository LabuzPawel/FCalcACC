# FCalcACC

This is an application made in Visual Studio 2022 in C# Windows Form Application for calculating fuel and pit strategy in Assetto Corsa Competizione. 

Originally project was created in python using tkinter GUI. Old script can be found in 'FCalcACC\python_old_script'.

Release version requieres .NET 8.0 Framework to work. Larger size exe release that is independent from .NET version can be found in 'FCalcACC/self_contained'.

Application is creating a 'FCalcACC_data.json' at first start up. This file stores user data.

Future plans:
1. Add fuel tank capacity and maximum stint duration to calculations.
2. More error handling.
3. Ability to move pit stop earlier/later in pit strategy
4. Telemetry integration with ACC.
