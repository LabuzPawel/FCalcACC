# FCalcACC

This is an application made in Visual Studio 2022 in C# Windows Form Application for calculating fuel and pit strategy in Assetto Corsa Competizione. 

Originally project was created in python using tkinter GUI. Old script can be found in 'FCalcACC/python_old_script'.

Release version requieres .NET 8.0 Framework to work. Larger size exe release that is independent from .NET version can be found in 'FCalcACC\bin\Release\self_contained'.

For application to work it requieres 'CARS.json' and 'TRACKS.json' files to be included in exe folder. Default versions of those json files can be found in 'FCalcACC\default_json'.

Future plans:

1. Better UI.
2. Error handling.
3. Telemetry integration with ACC.
